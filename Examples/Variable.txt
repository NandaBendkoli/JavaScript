🟢 LEVEL 1: BASIC FOUNDATIONS (warm-up but must be perfect)

What is a variable in JavaScript?

Why do we need variables?

How many ways can we declare variables in JavaScript?

Difference between declaring and initializing a variable?

What happens if you use a variable without declaring it?

Can a variable change its data type in JavaScript?

What is the default value of an uninitialized variable?

Is JavaScript statically typed or dynamically typed?

What is an identifier?

Are variable names case-sensitive in JavaScript?

🟡 LEVEL 2: var, let, const (MOST IMPORTANT)

Difference between var, let, and const?

Why was let introduced when var already existed? 

Why is var considered unsafe?

Can let be redeclared in the same scope?

Can const be reassigned?

Why must const be initialized at declaration?
ans:Because const creates an immutable binding,
and JavaScript does not allow an immutable binding to exist without an initial value.

Can we change the value of a const object?

What exactly is immutable in const?

Can var be used inside a block?

Why do modern JS projects avoid var?

🟠 LEVEL 3: SCOPE (very frequently asked)

What is scope in JavaScript?

Types of scope in JavaScript?

What is block scope?

What is function scope?

Is var block-scoped or function-scoped?

Is let block-scoped?

What happens to a variable when its scope ends?

Can two variables with same name exist in different scopes?

What is global scope pollution?

How do let and const help avoid scope-related bugs?

🔴 LEVEL 4: HOISTING & TDZ (SENIOR FAVOURITE)

What is hoisting?

Are variables hoisted in JavaScript?

Is var hoisted? If yes, how?

Is let hoisted?

What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?

Why does accessing let before declaration throw an error?

Difference between hoisting of var and let?

Why doesn’t const behave like var during hoisting?

Does hoisting move code physically?

How does TDZ help prevent bugs?

🧠 LEVEL 5: BINDING (ADVANCED / SENIOR LEVEL)

What is meant by “binding” in JavaScript?

Difference between variable as a container vs binding?

What is mutable binding?

What is immutable binding?

Does let create mutable or immutable bindings?

Does const create mutable or immutable bindings?

Why can const objects be modified?

Why does reassigning a const variable throw an error?

How are bindings related to scope?

How are bindings represented in the ECMAScript specification?

🔥 LEVEL 6: VARIABLES + MEMORY (VERY IMPORTANT)

How are primitive values stored in memory?

How are objects stored in memory?

What does a variable store for an object?

What happens in memory when you reassign a variable?

Difference between copying a primitive vs copying an object?

Why do objects behave differently from primitives?

What is pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference (JS version)?

How does memory relate to bindings?

What happens when a variable is set to null?

How does garbage collection relate to variables?

🔥 LEVEL 7: VARIABLES + CLOSURES (ADVANCED)

Why do variables inside closures not get destroyed?

Does a closure store values or bindings?

How does closure keep access to outer variables?

What happens to variables after a function returns?

Can closures cause memory leaks?

How does block scope affect closures?

Difference between closure with var vs let?

Why does let fix loop-related closure bugs?

How do closures use lexical scope?

Real-world use case of closures with variables?

🧨 LEVEL 8: TRICK & CONFUSION QUESTIONS (INTERVIEW TRAPS)

Why does typeof null return "object"?

Difference between null and undefined?

When should you use null instead of undefined?

Can a variable be both null and undefined?

What happens if you delete a variable?

Can you delete a let or const variable?

What happens if you shadow a variable?

What is variable shadowing?

Is shadowing bad practice?

Difference between shadowing and redeclaration?

Output of modifying const array.

Output of reassigning const object.

Output involving global vs local variable.

Output involving closure + variable.

Output involving TDZ.

Output involving shadowed variable.

Output involving function scope vs block scope.

🧠 LEVEL 10: DESIGN & BEST PRACTICES (SENIOR THINKING)

Why should we use const by default?

When should let be preferred over const?

Why is minimizing variable scope important?

How do variables affect maintainability?

How do variables affect readability?

How do variables affect debugging?

How do variables affect performance?

What are common variable-related bugs?

How do linters enforce good variable practices?
