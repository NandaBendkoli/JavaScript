JavaScript Engine – V8

The V8 engine developed by google powers google chrome and many other browsers and applications

A JavaScript engine like V8 is responsible for executing JavaScript code.
it takes the code you write and compiles it into machine code that the computer processor can execute directly.

Flow of execution is -->

JavaScript code → V8 engine → Parsing → AST (abstract syntax tree) → Bytecode → Machine code

Main Phases of JavaScript Execution in V8
1. Parsing

The V8 engine first parses the JavaScript code
breaking it down into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 
which represents the structure of the code.

Example:

var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a + b;


ast representation:

{
  "type": "Program", 
  // Root of the AST → whole JS file/script starts from here

  "body": [
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclaration",
      // This tells the engine: variables are being declared

      "declarations": [
        {
          "type": "VariableDeclarator",
          // One variable declaration entry

          "id": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "name": "a"
          },
          // Identifier → variable name is "a"

          "init": {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 10,
            "raw": "10"
          }
          // Literal → value assigned to variable "a" is 10
        },

        {
          "type": "VariableDeclarator",
          // Second variable declaration

          "id": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "name": "b"
          },
          // Variable name is "b"

          "init": {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 20,
            "raw": "20"
          }
          // Value assigned to "b" is 20
        }
      ],

      "kind": "var"
      // Type of declaration used → "var" (could also be let/const)
    }
  ],

  "sourceType": "script"
  // Tells engine this code is a normal JS script (not a module)
}

2. Compilation

V8 uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation where JavaScript code is compiled into machine code just before the execution.

it uses two main components:
a.Ignition – a lightweight interpreter that quickly generates bytecode.
and 
b.TurboFan – an optimizing compiler that converts bytecode into highly optimized machine code.

3.Garbage Collection
The V8 engine includes a garbage collector that automatically frees memory that is no longer in use
helping manage memory efficiently without manual intervention.
