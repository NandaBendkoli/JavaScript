What is JavaScript (JS)?

High-level → You don’t have to manage memory or handle low-level tasks. You can focus on the logic, and JavaScript takes care of the complex parts behind the scenes.
Example → You don’t need to manually free memory. JavaScript has automatic garbage collection and memory management.

Lightweight → JavaScript is designed to be fast and simple. It doesn’t need a heavy setup to start running; a browser is enough. You can write a few lines of code in the browser and see the result instantly.

Interpreted → JavaScript is read and executed line by line by the browser. The browser doesn’t fully compile the code into machine code before running it; instead, it reads one line at a time and executes it immediately.

JIT compiled (Just-In-Time) → JavaScript normally starts as an interpreted language, but that can be slow for large or complex programs. So modern JavaScript engines like the V8 engine (Chrome) use JIT compilation.

Example →
The code first runs line by line as an interpreter.
Then the engine notices which parts of the code are used frequently (like loops or repeatedly called functions).
It compiles those "hot" parts into machine code.
Now those parts run faster because they execute as native machine code.

Multi-paradigm → JavaScript supports multiple programming styles:
Functional programming → functions like map() and filter()
Object-oriented programming → classes and objects
Procedural programming → step-by-step execution

Prototype-based → JavaScript is prototype-based, meaning objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects through prototypes (refer to prototype_based.js file).



<!-- javascript engine -->
v8 engine developed by google
it powers google chrome and many other browsers and applications

javascript engine --> v8 is responsible for executing javascript code it takes the js code that u wrote 
and compiles it into machine code than the computer processor can execute directly

js code -------> v8 engine -------> .parsing
                                    .ast(abstract syntax tree)
                                    .bytecode
                                    .machine code


engine have mainly 3 phase to execute js code

1.parsing
the v8 engine first parse the js code breaking it down into ast abstract syntax tree
which represent the strcuture of the  code

example like 
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a + b;

ast = {
    "type":"Program",
    "body":[
        {
            "type":"VariableDeclaration",
            "declarations":[
                {
                    "type":"VariableDeclarator",
                    "id":{
                        "type":"Identifier",
                        "name":"a"
                    },
                    "init":{
                        "type":"Literal",
                        "value":10,
                        "raw":"10"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type":"VariableDeclarator",
                    "id":{
                        "type":"Identifier",
                        "name":"b"
                    },
                    "init":{
                        "type":"Literal",
                        "value":20,
                        "raw":"20"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "kind":"var"
        }
    ],
    "sourceType":"script"
}
